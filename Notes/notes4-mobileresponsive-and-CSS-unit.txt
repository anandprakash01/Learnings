Mobile responsive:
         By using rem/vh/vw units over pixels.
         By using max-width/max-height.
         Using CSS Media Queries.
         Setting up the viewport.

1.we have breakpoints to target the device screen.

2.we need to write media query for following devices:

   (i)phone and mobile - max-width:480px
   (ii)low resolution tablet and ipad - (min-width:481px) and (max-width:767px)
   (iii)portrait mode tablet and ipad - (min-width:768px) and (max-width:1024px)
   (iv)laptop - (min-width:1025px) and (max-width:1280px)
   (v)extra large screen - (min-width:1281px)
example:
@media (max-width:480px){

}  
3.Browser will take care automatically.
4.just we need to write breakpoints

CSS Units:

1.px 
2.em:
      Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element.
      10em means ten times of the parent element.
      for padding it will take x times the currunt font size

3.rem:
      Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.
      In general, <html> is the root element.
      In rem, "r" stands for "root."
      x rem=x times of font size

3.vh:
      It stands for viewport height.
      vh is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport height.
      Example: Suppose height of the browser is 1000px, so 1vh is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.
      1vh = 1% of viewport height.

4.vw:
      It stands for viewport width.
      Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport width.
      Example: Suppose width of the browser is 1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.
      1vw = 1% of viewport width
