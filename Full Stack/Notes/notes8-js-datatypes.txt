primitive Datatypes:
    1.string
    2.number
        //everything is number in javascript.
        //there is no difference between float and integer number.
    3.boolean
        true/false
    4.undefined.
        empty
        example:
        declaration with initialization:
        var fullName = “akash”;
        example:
        declaration
        var fullName;

derived types:
        object 
        array 
        Object:
        example:
        var personAkash = {
            fullName:"akash",
            age: 34
        }
//inside the object order doesn't matter compiler will take care.
==================================
Dynamic Datatypes:
//Once you assign one variable with one type you can change in later in javascript.
//To avoid this we need to use another language this is called typescript.
============================
JSON:
//It is one type of data format to transfer

Basic array:
//It is used to store the data continously.
//We can store different datatypes together continously.
//array index always will start from zero.
syntax:
[] - array bracket
Four operation:
CRUD - create,read,update,delete
To add element at the end position we need to use push() method
To remove the element at the end position we need to use pop() method
push() and pop() will remove one element at a time.

how to find the length of the array.
array.length
=================================
Object:
CRUD - Create|Read|Update|Delete 
//position is not matter inside the object only keys 
//no duplicate keys inside the object.
=========================
Array of objects 
objects of array.
=======================
functions:
//It is used to help to call same function multiple times to get the job done.
//it helps to avoid duplication in code
=====================================
